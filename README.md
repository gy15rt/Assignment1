Code for the agent based model

The code includes a section designed to show the model working as an animation, in order for this to work it is necessary to write %matplotlib qt in to the console to produce a pop up window. the animation then plays in the pop up. This didn't work on my home laptop nor did making changes to the graphic backend in Spyder (Tools - Preferences - Ipython Console - Graphics - Graphics Backend - Backend:"automatic"). I leave it in in the hope that your system allows it to work once the comments # are removed.
